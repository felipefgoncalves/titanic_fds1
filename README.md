<h1>Udacity's Nanodegree</h1>
<h2>Data Science Fundamentals</h2>

<p>This course was divided in two parts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1</strong>: Python Introduction<br></li>
    <li><strong>Module 2</strong>: Python for Data Analysis</li>
  </ul>
<p>In Module 1, Python Introduction, we learned Python basics and how to handle CSV files in Python. Basically a Python coding project using the Chicago Bikeshare dataset.</p>
<p>In Module 2, Python for Data Analysis, we dived into the Jupyter Notebook, importing data, cleaning data, asking questions, finding answers and sharing the conclusions with the Titanic dataset. This was my final project in Data Science Fundamentals. Here you will find my research and answers based on the Titanic CSV data.</p>

<p>Project one (p1) is <a href="https://github.com/felipefgoncalves/titanic_fds1/blob/master/p1/chicago_bikeshare.py">here</a><br>Final project (p2) <a href="https://github.com/felipefgoncalves/titanic_fds1/blob/master/p2/titanic_project_PTBR.ipynb">here</a> (in Portuguese).</p>
